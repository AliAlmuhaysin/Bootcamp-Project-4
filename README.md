## Problem

The problem here is that some trainees withdraw from the Tamheer program after a certain period of their registration has passed. Therefore, we created a model that predicts the possibility of the trainee completing or withdrawing from the Tamheer program.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset was taken from open data and contains the following columns: ID - The gender of the trainee - City Apprentice - Trainee District - Specialization of the trainee - Trainee Qualification - Trainee rate - rate from - The age of the trainee is - Trainee status - Name of the training opportunity - The economic activity of the training opportunity - Training qualification - The size of the training institution - The economic activity of the training institution - The educational institution of the trainee

| decision tree |99% |
| random forest |99%|
| KNN |%|
